                    In a perfect world, maintaining a work-life balance lets you prioritize both work and life responsibilities equally. Since we don’t live in an ideal world, creating a flawless balance between your work and personal duties can be challenging. This doesn’t mean that you can’t strive to create a healthy balance between your work and life responsibilities, though. Instead, it means that you must set realistic goals at home and at the office.

                    You should expect disruptions to this balance and anticipate the scales between work and life duties to shift frequently. Work responsibilities often interfere with personal commitments, and personal issues can impact work performance. It’s essential, however, to recognize what factors can negatively impact your work-life balance.

                    By now, you’re probably wondering what the ideal work-life balance looks like. If you’re of the mindset that more work hours mean higher productivity levels, you might want to reconsider. While everyone is different, studies show that the ideal workweek consists of 38 hours. Research shows that productivity levels drop significantly after 50 hours per week. If that’s not enough to convince you, the World Health Organization report shows that the risk of heart disease, including strokes and heart attacks, increases for those working more than 55 hours per work.

                    Despite the research behind these numbers, it’s essential to determine exactly what your ideal work-life balance looks like. Consider factors such as how many hours you are expected to work each week, your financial responsibilities, and home-life duties when identifying what a healthy work-life balance looks like to you.
                    
                    If you’re ready to reap these rewards, now is the time to take action.

                    Your number one priority should always be to take care of your mental and physical health. After all, if you’re not healthy, you won’t be able to meet commitments to work or your family. If it’s been a while since you’ve been to the doctor, schedule a wellness visit. Then, join a gym or sign up for a fitness class to ensure you’re getting plenty of exercise. Also, focus on improving your eating habits and try to get at least seven hours of sleep each night. Finally, take frequent breaks during the week and take a vacation if possible.
